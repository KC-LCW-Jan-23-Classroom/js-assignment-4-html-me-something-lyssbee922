      <h2>Stitching</h2>
      <p><div>Stitching is best done in signatures, which the basics of I won't cover in this 
         blog. The intracasies of paper usage are very complex and take up a lot of time. 
         For now, let's imagine that you have your paper ready for stitching in whatever size 
         signatures is good for your project. 
         For basic stitching you will need: <ol>
            <li>An awl</li>
            <li>A needle and thread</li>
            <li>A pair of scissors</li>
         </ol>
         Once you have gathered your items, you will make evenly spaced marks on the folded 
         edge of your signatures in whatever increments is good for your project. My preferred 
         book size is 5x7, and I usually will make a mark 0.5 inches from the bottom and top edge, 
         then fill the middle with evenly spaced 1 inch increments. Then, use the awl to pierce 
         through the spine of each signature at that mark. Having each hole on each signature match 
         up will be very important so measure carefully.</div>
